    tool as though it were a regular blog. Rather than storing the passed in
    blog entry the way that a regular blog would, this tool updates the
    timestamp on a file in the filesystem.  The timestamp on that file can then
    be monitored externally.  Assuming an external process which is sending
    email messages to this tool at regular intervals, if the timestamp fails
    to update for a period of time one can presume that something is broken
    in mailin and a developer can be alerted to investigate.
