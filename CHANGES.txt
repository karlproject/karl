  previously indexed when an external converter was unavailable to be properly
  reindexed after the external converter is added to the system.

  in the container, append a suffix to the name.  (LP #821206)

- Fixed a DST issue in the versions.format_local_date() function which

  through email will have the correct time.  Also, prefer to use the
  delivery timestamp provided by repoze.postoffice 0.17+. (LP #837699)

- Use modern SI prefixes for file size display.  (1 KB = 1000 bytes)

  was supplied via a <meta> content type tag. (LP #848194)

- Made the Trash folder aware of documents that may have been marked deleted in
  a folder because they were moved to another folder. Documents that are still

  viewing a page that is currently being edited.

  subsystem, which limits the status report to only the subsystem(s) specified.

3.55 (2011-04-04)
-----------------

- Added 'karl.scripting.only_once' API, to permit cron-driven scripts to
  avoid running again if an earlier instance is still running.
  The lockfile is named '<username>-<progname>', where '<username> is the
  current user's login name, and '<progname>' is a string passed to
  'only_once'.  By default, the lockfile is created in '/var/run/karl/';
  this path can be overridden by setting 'lockdir' in the 'DEFAULT' section
  of the configuration file.

  when the mailinglist is added / removed.  (LP #706018).

  Karl to be mountable at places other than '/' at a particular domain.

  e-mail distribution lists. (LP #705171)

  point. (LP #651279)

-----------------

- gave profile body a set width, so it doesn't fall out of its
  area in IE (LP #638326)

  users in searches and in the people directory.  Updated the admin
  edit profile view to handle inactive users. (LP# 629612)

  'Fred Flintstone (Inactive)'.  This makes inactive users easier to notice

  and button same height and/or centered vertically.  (LP #622689)

- Tabs and newline characters in uploaded filenames are now converted to
  spaces. Same is also done in the download_file_view when setting the
  filename in the Content-Disposition header, in case there are files
  uploaded previously with newline and tab characters in the filename.
  (LP #616511)

- Rename user script can now rename or merge profiles which don't have
  logins.

3.43 (2010-08-19)
-----------------

- Changes searches so there is no label, changed buttons to say
  'search' instead of 'go'
  (LP #616868)

- Put in deprecation notice for IE6 (yay!)
  (LP #616869)

- Ensured that comment alerts work for comments made agaisnt forum posts
  (LP #614370).

- Ensured that CSV profile import decodes attributes encoded as UTF8
  or latin1 (LP #614398).

- Fixed text indexing of profiles with attributes encoded as UTF8 or latin1
  (LP #614398).

- Added a community index to the tagging enginge in order to speed up the
  community tags portlet when first loaded. On local machine loading of
  community tags portlet with OSI database went from 40s to 3ms.

- Wrote an evolve script to find content that is created or modified by a user
  no longer in the system and move that content over to a 'former user'
  profile.  The 'former user' profile is created if and only if it is needed.

- Improved search performance by not using the catalog cache for very large
  result sets, as the overhead in marshalling the result set in order to cache
  it is much greater than the overhead of running the search.  (LP #6120123)

- Added postoffice quarantine to error monitor admin ui for parallelism with
  the status view for monitoring.  (LP #613579)

- Mailin now concatenates all 'text/plain' message parts when constructing the
  document body.  Previously only the first 'text/plain' message part was used.
  This is per discussion with OSI about including forwarded messages in mailin.

- The text scrubber used for mailin now takes a new argument, 'is_reply',
  indicating whether the message is a reply to another email.  This is checked
  by looking for the presence of the 'In-Reply-To' header in the message.  If
  the message is not a reply, the text_scrubber now omits the processing
  where it attempts to separate the new message body from the quoted message
  being replied to.  This processing was causing messages being forwarded to
  Karl communities to be stripped of content, since for some email clients
  (Outlook Express) the separator for replied to messages and inline forwarded
  messages is the same.  Since a forwarded message shouldn't have the
  'In-Reply-To' header set, this allows forwarded messages to be properly added
  to Karl, while still doing the proper thing when users make comments by
  replying to alert emails.  Based on discussion with OSI.

- Updated the 'add comment' form to respect the IShowSendalert adapter.
  (LP #602889)

- Converted retry functionality used when running console scripts as daemons to
  be time based rather than number of iterations based.  By default, now, if
  a daemon script gets ConflictErrors, it will retry once a minute for 30
  minutes.  If unable to fulfill its duties for 30 minutes, it will raise an
  exception which will trigger all of the usual alarm bells. (LP #614368)

- Replaced the notion of deleting users with the notion of deactivating users.
  Deactivated users are effectively deleted except that their profiles may
  still be viewed by clicking a link on content which the deactivated user
  had authored.  LP #599805

- Fixed bug (found by random code review) in community stats report where
  calendar events were not counted.

- Created user activity report.  LP #599804

  intranet layout. (LP #612576)

3.39 (2010-07-29)
-----------------

- reduced width on login username input for IE6, so it doesn't
  fall to the next line.  Set margin on surrounding field as
  !important, because elements were jumping after focus was moved
  away (LP #611017)

- removed unnecessary margin from profile image, so the middle content
  doesn't get pushed down (LP #610666)

- fixed add tag button on edit screen for IE8 (LP #610549)

- edited the admin right side portlets to match new portlet styles (LP #610493)

- Added support for logging each query, to compare performance across
  different configurations. Keyed on the `query_log_all` parameter, defaulting
  to False. Entries will be added to `log/query/everything.log`.

- Fixed bug in mailin2 script that caused ZEO connections to be left open if
  there was a configuration error.

- Fixed bug in entity conversion where numeric entities were not converted.

- Removed a redundant copy of the text_scrubber code used by mailin.

- Add some preprocessing to the mailin text scrubber to find URLs and mark
  them up as links using markdown syntax.  (LP #545420)

- Reproduced the websites normalization performed when editing a profile via
  the UI in the cico XML import, so that profile websites data downloaded from
  GSA will also be normalized by prepending 'http://' to websites which begin
  with 'www.'.  Also added an evolve script to normalize the websites field for
  existing profiles.  (LP #605203)

- Convert non-standard mimetypes sent by Internet Explorer for jpeg and png
  image files to their more standard equivalents.  (LP #608473)

- Made all unknown image/* types viewable in default mime info.  (LP #608473)

- Added a utility and console script for renaming users. (LP #606339)

- Removed link to __error_log__ from admin ui.  (LP #581949)

3.38 (2010-07-09)

  breaking when font size is changed (LP #602837)

- Fix handling  of 'website' in admin CSV user upload. (LP #602473)

- tempfolder:  suppress sending events on add / remove, and therefore
  any catalog activity for objects in the temporary location. (LP #592697)


3.37 (2010-07-06)
-----------------

- further cleaning up of portlet styles to make them all the same (LP #599522)

  - set up related tags portlet and its .rightcol space to be styled like the
    other portlets in the site.

  - removed now unused CSS code.

  - gave .rightcol a left margin to put space between the portlet and text

  - reduced space above and below portlet title

- cico people import:  fixed the fix for singular 'website' element
  transform (LP #601205).

- tagging engine:  optimized 'getFrequency' (LP #597838).

- upload users view:  don't pass 'groups' to profile factory (LP #598246).

- portlet styles - cleaned up CSS for status message,
  applied new styles to profile tags portlet (LP #599522)

  - conformed way the code is laid out

  - fixed small errors

- Styled the site announcement to look like a status message. (LP #600765)

- Updated mailin code to respect X-Postoffice-Rejected headers coming from
  repoze.postoffice and special cased the bounce message when a message is
  rejected to due to vacation loop detection throttling. (LP #597835)

- hid the overflow on the main content area, so that when wide items are
  entered, the entire content area won't fall beneath the left menu in IE.
  (LP #576042)

3.36 (2010-06-27)
-----------------

- Fixed UI bug where actions in folder views did not correspond to user's
  permissions.  (LP #594180)

- Added evolve script to remove some broken objects that seem to be left over
  from the migration of profile photos to image drawer.  These were blocking
  reindexing of profiles.  (LP #594131)

- Fixed bug where profiles add via cico (OSI, using gsa_sync) were indexed with
  a bogus value for the 'allowed' index. Updated evolve script to reindex the
  people directory.  (LP #594131)

- Added stub for console script, reindex_peopledir.

- Fixed bug where 'home_path' was being clobbered by edit profile form.
  (LP #594127)

- Updated the rss feed update code to only update a feed if the upstream feed
  contains entries.  (LP #594352)

3.35 (2010-06-08)
-----------------

- Members views were not updated to use the new websites field after multiple
  websites change from 3.34, which caused an unexpected parameter error when
  creating a new profile after invitation. Fixed and updated tests. (LP #591267)

- Fixed bug in whitelist--address matching is now normalized to be indifferent
  to the inclusion or exclusion of a name part with an email address.  (IE,
  'Fred Flintstone <test@example.com>' == 'test@example.com')

3.34 (2010-06-04)
-----------------

- Updated formatting for wiki body in e-mail alerts (LP #588905)

  otherwise it will still use the old views.

- LP #588303 Added fax to profile view.

- LP #589743 Form topic add comment form was still assuming old formencode
  system.  It has been updated to be current.

- Add community and profile statistics to admin UI.

3.32 (2010-05-20)

  extension or customization packages to extend the set of indexes used
  in the catalog.

- Made the "view all" view work for reference sections (LP #575712).

- Allow nesting of sub-sections within reference sections (LP #575712).
  Also allow adding pages and files at the root of reference manuals, making
  them behave like reference sections.

3.29 (2010-04-30)
-----------------

- Added an "Any" option at the end of the letterbox to allow clearing
  any existing filter (LP#/570853).

- On each communities sub-view, add a "quick links" panel on the right
  margin, with tabs showing tool links, recent content, and members.
  The last two are fetched on demand using AJAX.  This panel is currently
  disabled unless 'demo' is in the query string. See
  http://dev.karlproject.org/specifications/communitydiscovery.html#step-2-quick-links

- Implemented sub-views for the '/communities/' page:  "Mine" (communities
  of which I am a member), "Active" (communities having acitivty within
  the past 30 days), and "All".  Drop the "My communities" portlet.  This
  menu is currently disabled unless 'demo' is in the query string.  See

3.28 (2010-04-22)
-----------------

- Introduce trivial AttachmentsSequence widget, along with slight markup and
  javascript tweaks, to get the attachment field on the various formish forms
  to work more like the pre-formish implementation (see LP#564130).

- Get intranets root edit form to correctly default to the sample_feature
  value when the feature field is left blank.

- Re-specify default 'sendalert' value as True on calendar event add form
  (fixes LP#564115).

  poorly formed (read: very long words w/ no word break, e.g. a long URL)
  content is pulled into a side portlet (fixes LP#540296).

- Slight tweaks to the Network Events search UI and behavior to improve user
  experience (see LP#554028).

- Sacrifice a chicken and provide a default value for the 'min_pw_length'
  setting since certain invocations of the test framework cause that to not
  yet be initialized.

  selected for deletion.

- LP# 544199 Added 'path' to content selection grid used in some admin views.

- Add evolve script to retroactively prepend 'http://' to any profile website
  URLs that start with 'www.' (see LP#554013)

- Fix profile admin edit form so that the community memberships don't
  disappear when the groups are updated (fixes LP#556679)

- Slight tweak to the KarlManageMembers widget so it won't blow up when
  faced with a community that has no members

- Profile 'website' field now requires submitted values to start with
  'http://', 'https://', or 'www.'; if the last one is used 'http://' will be
  prepended to the stored value (fixes LP#554013)

- Re-add "default tool" dropdown to the add community form
  (fixes LP#554031)

- In order to be able to kill runaway converter processes correctly,
  change ``karl.utilities.baseconverter.BaseConverter.execute``: when
  creating a subprocess, don't use a shell to start the process
  (``shell=False``), use ``subprocess.PIPE`` as stdin, use
  ``subprocess.PIPE`` as stderr.

- Change converters that use ``execute``: don't try to redirect stderr
  output via the command.

- Change rtf2xml converter to not change directory to /tmp (not sure
  why it was doing that in the first place) as part of its execute
  command.

- Change rtf2xml converter to not pass ``--no-dtd`` on the command
  line.  This option has no effect on any recent rtf2xml command I can
  find.

- LP #552517: Fixed bug where new uploads w/ the same filename would fail
  to actually update the stored file.

- LP #553959 Fixed bug in edit_intranet form that would corrupt the portlets.

- LP #554024 Changed the 'delete community' operation to use a new permission,
  'delete community' rather than overload the 'moderate' permission.

- LP #556673 Only display buttons to add calendar events if user has permission
  to create events in the calendar.

- LP #556036 Get static revision from subversion revision, if possible.

- LP #510248 Hide 'Advanced' button on folders outside of intranets.

3.25 (2010-03-25)
-----------------

- LP #546902: Removed the 500 character limit validator from the 'text'
  field on the community member and new user invite forms.

- Fixed a failing unittest for mailin dispatcher.  Did not affect production
  usage.

3.24 (2010-03-22)
-----------------

- LP #532879 Added a try/except block to catch ParseError exceptions
  in JQuery live search view to avoid contaminating error logs with
  ignored exceptions.

- The wiki links would not work for non-ascii characters because the
  title was saved as unicode and the text as html entities, causing
  the link matching code to return zero matches. Added function to
  unescape entities from links before comparison to fix this.

- LP #530799 (partial): Converted the following forms to use formish
  instead of enformed for form generation and validations: profile edit,
  admin profile edit, add user, add news item, edit news item, add
  intranet, edit intranet, edit intranets root, add page, edit page.

- LP #544201 Added check for 'create' permission on target for mailin.

-----------------

- LP #538272: Fixed add / edit community forms to pass the page_title
  in to the TemplateAPI object instead of directly to the template.

- LP #533366 Added simple retry capability to run_daemon, primarily to
  avoid tripping the error monitor when conflict errors ocurr.

- LP #538273:  Added a '--timeout' option to 'update_feeds' script:  if
  passed, sets the global socket timeout accordingly.

3.22 (2010-03-12)
-----------------

- LP #530893 Updated mail sending code to use repoze.sendmail 2.0.

- LP #520570:  redirect '/favicon.ico' requests onto the correct static
  URL, and 'rss_view.xml' requests to the equivalent 'atom.xml' URLs.

- LP #530893 Added handling for RFC 2047 (Unicode) headers to all generated
  emails.

- LP #530893 Added handling for RFC 2047 (Unicode) headers to mailin.

- LP #531360 Fixed bug in people import where categories were not being
  properly reset at import time.

3.21 (2010-03-06)

  utility method, get_show_sendalert, to get whether or not to show a send
  alert checkbox in a form adding content.

3.20 (2010-03-04)
-----------------

- Updated bootstrap to provide new 'name' parameter to add_intranet_view when

  TemplateAPI object instead of passing it directly into the template
  (rafrombrc)

- LP #520541 Updated adduser console script to also create a user profile.
  Added checks to avoid clobbering an existing user.

- Fixed calendar list view to correctly show "all-day" for all-day events.

- LP #522173: Add a "down for maintenance" HTML page in views/static
  with relative links to styling and images which can be served
  directly by Apache.

- When importing users, using cico, any space characters in the user's id are
  now elided.

- LP #523333: find_contiguous_slot error error in calendar

3.16 (2010-02-12)
-----------------

- Add "evolve5" step which converts calendar layers and categories to
  have opaque object ids.

- Made the (+) on all-day events on the calendar day and week
  views functional.

- Fixed links to all-day events on the calendar day view.

- LP #510242: change submit buttons to say "submit" (as has been the
  case in previous releases) rather than "Edit" or "Add".

- LP #510770: Sort categories by title rather than path.

- LP #510304: Add/edit calendar event should show default category
  first always.

- LP #513340: Calendar event blocks not formatting correctly in IE

- LP #510240: Formish edit screens have wrong heading

- LP #506106: "accept invitation" refused with password length error
  no matter what password length provided.

- LP #510187: Get the display for per-office data in People reports to
  match the previous layout.

- LP #497437: Fixed all-day event option for calendar events.

- LP #503442: Fixed hardcoded year left in calendar week view template.

- LP #510285: Use opaque identifiers for new category and layer ids to
  make it possible to add a category with the same label as a layer
  and vice versa.

- LP #509597: IndexError on Calendar _find_contiguous_slot_across_days

- LP #503451: Fixed multi-day calendar event not on both days.

- LP #503771: Fixed day links on calendar list view.

- LP #503523: AttributeError: 'CalendarEvent' object has no attribute 'color'

- LP #503450: Fixed that the hour and minute selectors on the add calendar
  event page would lose their all-day state if the user entered an end date
  that was before the start date.

- LP #496331: Calendar list view now shows a paginated listing of upcoming
  events with 20 events per page.

- Merged svn+ssh://osi@osi.agendaless.com/home/osi/bfgsvn/karl/branches/formish
  branch, which replaces some form-based views with formish forms.

- Added missing registration for IFileInfo adapter for ICommunityRootFolder.

- Fixed bug in evolve2 step that updated 'Last Activity' for every community.

- Fixed bug with attachments on mailin caused by a bogus assertion which would
  usually fail.

- Bug fix: Make sure acl's are properly set on profiles during import.

- LP #494582 Added opensearch support to people directory.  (Ported from OSI.)

- Bug fix: Make sure custom_folder_view uses get_layout_provider utility
  method.

- Explicit registration of an IFolderAddables is no longer required.  A
  suitable default is found if there is no registration.  Added
  'get_folder_addables' utility method.

- Created a default footer that just contains the offices listing component of
  OSI's footer.

- Bug fix: Allow add/edit forms for calendar event to still work if there is no
  category.  Categories are not used outside of the context of the calendar
  tool, and calendar events can appear in regular old folders in intranets.
  This allows to again create and edit events in the 'network-news' folder used
  in most intranets..

- LP #497937 Corrected which tools are addable when creating a new community.

- LP #488152 Made initial site_acl used in boostrapping the same in core as
  what OSI uses.

  useful to Karl administrators.

- Added syslog functionality.

- Added a monitor utility for errors in various Karl subsystems.

- Fixed bug in workflow where unicode was breaking status messages.

- Fixed bug in karl.views.utils._get_user_homepath.  Was expecting traverser
  to return a list for subpath but traverser was returning a tuple.

- Fixed bug displaying "system" profiles.  Karl instances generally have one
  system profile, "admin", that does not have an entry in site.users, since
  the profile is not used to log into the site but only as a placeholder user
  profile for associating with events generated by the system, usually when
  bootstrapping a new Karl.

- Exclude objects which don't provide IContent from 'texts' catalog index.
  (Only content objects should show up in search.)

- Added specific exclusion for ICalendarLayer from 'texts' catalog index.

- Fixed bug with mailin quarantine monitor generating bad links to quarantined
  messages.  Ended up taking entirely different approach to mounting the
  repoze.mailin.monitor subapplication.  Implementation this time around is
  messy but should look prettier when BFG 1.3 is ready.

- Added daemon mode to scripts that were being called as cron jobs: mailin,
  qp, update_feeds, and digest.

3.15 (2009-12-14)
-----------------

- LP #496330: Clicking the (+) from the calendar month view now uses
  a default of 9:00am instead of 12:00am.

- LP #494701: Editing a calendar event now populates the form with
  the correct times.

- LP #492346: Clicking the (+) button to add a new event on the calendar
  views now populates a default date and time on the form based on the
  context of where (+) was clicked.

- LP #491991: An event's calendar category is now displayed when
  viewing the event.

- LP #491986: Constrain width of category selector on calendar setup page.

- Increase performance of jQuery selectors in calendar daily/weekly view

- Fix editing of calendar categories/layers when names have spaces

- Calendar categories and layers are now managed on the same setup page.

- Preload button images better so that they don't flickr on hover/click

- Change calendar "Add Event" button to not be an image so that it is easier
  to test and change the label if needed

- Speed up rendering of any page shown inside the community layout by
  roughly 2X.

- LP #444502: Added a sample content generation script.

- "Settings" action on calendar tool now allows the choice of a color
  along with a virtual calendar name.

- Add a new field index named "virtual" to the catalog.  The initial
  use for this index is to be able to query for catalog events
  globally for the purposes of creating a "dynamic" calendar: the
  ``virtual`` index, for catalog events, will be populated with a
  tuple: ``(calendar_path, virtual_calendar_name)``.  This tuple can
  be used in queries by the dynamic catalog machinery (which will need
  to spell out a set of tuples naming these calendars, and query the
  "virtual" catalog field index using the tuples in an OR clause along
  with, e.g. ``interfaces=(ICatalogEvent,)``.

- If a user doesn't have an associated profile, don't fail hard
  when trying to reindex the peopledir catalog.

- LP #434879 Add support for pasting into livesearch

- The RSS icon on the new calendar views is now placed on the lower
  right for consistency with the other pages.

- Removed the "View Earlier Events" and "View Later Events" from
  the list view on the new calendar.  These duplicate the functions
  of the forward/backward buttons and are not necessary.

- The "Settings" page of the existing calendar has been temporarily
  hidden on the UI until the new calendar is finished.  Requested
  by Jason Lantz to prevent confusion.

- LP #430037 In karl.content.adapters, use functions in
  ``karl.utilities.converters`` instead of an xslt-using function
  named ``_html_cleaner``.  The ``_html_cleaner`` was producing
  incorrect results when fed HTML provided by the rich text input
  widget.

- Moved "karl.content" into this package (as the content subdirectory).

- LP #418687 Add better looking status messages

- LP #418701 Add better styling of form buttons

- LP #356541 Added better icons for file/folder listings including Folder,
  Reference Manual, Page, Calendar Event, and News items.

- Updated edit_acl view to allow workflow transitions, including re-inserting
  an object with a previously customized acl back into a proper workflow state.

- LP #426385 Added a few extra parameters to template call for
  admin_edit_profile view.  Extra paramaters used by OSI custom template.

- The ID of an uploaded should not include directory names provided
  by the browser, if any.  This was solved previously for Windows but not
  for POSIX (forward slash) path names.

- The new calendar pages have now replaced the original calendar.

- LP #449690 Moved text scrubber utility for mailin to core.  Moved mailin
  monitor sub-application to core.

- Removed out of date paster template.  This has been superceded by KarlSample
  project.

- Made setting of categories via peopleconf util optional.  OSI will set
  categories via gsa_sync, so peopleconf needs to be able to handle the
  categories and reports separately.

- Removed all references to ISecurityWorkflow, in favor of newer worfklow
  system.

- LP #449686 Moved workflow policy to core.  All known Karl instances were
  using the same policy, so for maintenance it makes sense to move this to
  the core.  Since the workflows are hooked up via ZCML these "default"
  workflows can always be overridden in a customization package.

- LP #449676 Moved most console scripts into core to avoid duplication across
  all of the customization packages.  Entry points are still declared in
  customization packages to allow partners to opt out of or replace particular
  console scripts.

- LP #449683 Moved initial data for bootstrapping Karl in the core and made
  overridable via utility registrations on the interfaces in
  karl.bootstrapping.interfaces.

- LP #449683 Moved Paste Deploy application factory (aka run.py) into core (as
  application.py).

- LP #449691 Moved evolve script to core and updated it to use utility
  registrations in ZCA to find packages to evolve.  This allows us to maintain
  a set of evolution steps inside the core that would be common to all
  instances of Karl while still allowing for customer specific evolutions in
  the customization packages.

- LP #449683 Evolution DB versions are now set at bootstrap time, whether
  called from application.py or the startover script.  The startover script
  has been moved to core.

- LP #449689 Added standalone.zcml for running Karl without a customization
  package.

- Moved OSI's notion of 'intranets' (aka offices) into core Karl for use by
  other Karl instances.

- LP #491984 Fixed bug where folder contents deletion warning was being used
  for any folderish object rather than just folders under the Files tab.

- LP #492382 Added an argument for the form class to admin_edit_profile_view,
  allowing third party customizations to still use the view logic and just
  change the form validation.

3.14 (2009-09-08)
-----------------

- Hide all states in workflow UI that aren't current and have no valid
  exit transitions.

- Fixed error message in error page middleware.

- Merged 'chrism_workflow' branch.

- LP #418695 Bold communities for which logged in user is moderator in "My
  communities" portlet.

- LP #422571 Added convert_entities function to karl.views.utils.  Updated atom
  entry adapters to convert entities in content.

- LP #422572 Made some changes to atom feed based on feed validator
  recommendations: Added "updated" element to feed.  Added rel="self" attribute
  to "link" elements.

- Fixed bug discovered in alert digests--email recipients were not being
  properly passed as a list.  Digests could not have worked at all.  Surprised
  there was no bug report.  (15 users in OSI have alert preferences set to
  digest.)

- LP #422586 Enabled alert digests to send attachments via email.

3.13 (2009-08-26)
-----------------

- Ignore emails with a header that indicates they were auto-generated,
  such as out of office replies.  Like Mailman, Karl now looks for the
  non-standard but widely supported Precedence header, as well as the
  new, standard Auto-Submitted field.

3.12 (2009-08-19)
-----------------

- LP #413137 Export as CSV was producing a unicode header; WSGI only accepts
  byte strings.

- LP #399427 Removed send_alert field from ICommunityContent interface.

- LP #399427 Allow use of default for Alerts utility, making registration
  unnecessary except to shim in a dummy test implementation in unittests.

- LP #412463 Publish atom feeds as escaped HTML rather than embedded XHTML.

3.11 (2009-08-17)
-----------------

- LP #414799 Made system name configurable in Karl error page wsgi middleware.

- LP #414799 Scrubbed 'KARL' from UI.

3.10 (2009-08-12)
-----------------

- LP #412478 In mail-in, replace empty message body with warning message.

3.9 (2009-08-11)
----------------

- LP #408946: Give visual LS feedback and pause on multiple words

- LP #409495: Fix broken General KARL Error Screen in IE

- Disabled browser form autocomplete in the add user form (without this,
  the browser fills the password field with the current user's password).

- Log more info about dropped email messages.

- Made the mail white list case-insensitive.

3.8 (2009-08-06)
----------------

- Removed OSI-specific change password link logic from edit_profile view.

- The peopleconf utility now has the option to force reindexing of the
  people directory catalog.

- LP #409408: IE refuses to download files over HTTPS when the
  Cache-Control header specifies no-cache or no-store.  Switched to
  "private, must-revalidate", which seems to be the generally
  recommended header for dynamic apps.

- LP #409499: Reference Manual delete produces TypeError


3.7 (2009-08-04)
----------------

- LP #407445: Provide rounded corners on tag boxes in IE

- LP #403648: Fix right margin in IE on anonymous layout

- Use the newer ISecurityWorkflow API (pass request in to all relevant
  methods).

- LP #404205: For the new people directory, renamed the unconfigured
  "All KARL" tab to "All".  Use peopledirectory.xml to configure it.
  Also added the ability to filter reports by arbitrary (but fixed)
  catalog query parameters.

- LP #408156: Added a catalog index that makes it possible to show
  only non-staff in a people directory report.

- LP #405361: Selecting a letter in the new people directory did not
  survive pagination.

- Partial solution to LP #407017: disable autocomplete in
  admin_edit_profile.html and validate changes to home_path.

- Added reverse look up for countries.

- LP #407510: Show all fields in admin_edit_profile.html.

- Enabled text relevance ranking in search results.

3.6 (2009-07-23)
----------------

- Use resources rooted in "static" rather than in "static/custom";
  anything in static is allowed to be overriden.

- LP #400732: Reorganize and cleanup CSS to reduce file size and
  complexity.

- Use a start-time versioned URL for static resources.  This implies
  that the "static_postfix" setting is no longer required (the version
  number is generated and consumed by the system itself, rather than
  requiring a version number to be set in configuration).

- Use a 5 year static resource expiration time to work around browser
  caching bugs.

- Use "repoze.enformed" package to do form validation and rendering;
  "form" templates are now inlined into their constituent "real"
  templates.

- Made FakeEmailDelivery quiet by default.

- Better fault tolerance when killing processes using Python < 2.6 via
  utilities.baseconverter._ProcTimeout

- Made the name of the logo image configurable (so that it can be a PNG
  rather than a GIF).

- LP #398940, LP #398951: Added spelling checker for TinyMCE editor.  This
  requires the ``aspell`` command.  Please see the buildout README.txt for
  instructions on installing Aspell.

- Moved the ``ok.html`` and ``zodbinfo.html`` views to karl core since
  all partners need them.

3.5.1 (2009-07-17)
------------------

- LP #400767: Fixed AttributeError on activity listings.

3.5 (2009-07-16)
----------------

- LP #383666: Paste from Word to blog posts emails content but drops from
  blogentry

- LP #398914: Scale and crop uploaded profile photos to fit 75 x 100.
  The original image uploads are available under the name
  "source_photo", for example, /profiles/admin/source_photo .

- LP #390767: In the recent activity list, show the person who edited,
  rather than the original creator.

- LP #396581: Most links to a comment should show the comment in context.

- LP #397196: Added a page that links to admin tools (/static/admin.html)

- Updated paster template.

- LP #399396: Fix styling on list items.

- LP #399408: Reformat Network Events portlet to better display long titles

3.4 (2009-07-09)
----------------

- LP #394355: Don't commit changes to sqlite "pending messages" table if
  ZODB raises a conflict error.

- LP #391264: Added an administrator-level user edit view.

- LP #391259: Added an administrator-level user add view.

- LP #397030: Use quarantine for messages that fail to process during mail-in.

- Got rid kludgy '.error' file for mail-in, since the quarantine renders it
  obsolete.

3.3 (2009-07-06)
----------------

- Add fault tolerance to mail-in for message bodies with unknown non-unicode
  character encodings.

- Add a ``karl_project`` paster template (unfinished) in order to
  bootstrap a KARL customization.  The code used is an amalgam of
  Tres' ``non_osi_template`` package updated with recent changes to
  the OSI package.

- Forward compat: use the "repoze.bfg.view.static" helper rather than
  rolling our own view to serve static files in karl.views.site.

- LP #392561:  get 'content_modified' set correctly on communities when
  adding content.

- LP #391234:  Use a non-forked version of the repoze.who auth_tkt plugin
  (repoze.who 1.0.15, now in the "lemonade" index has the "max age" feature
  which made this fork necessary).

- LP #391246:  Removed concept of "vocabularies" as a persistently stored
  thing with indirection.  Placed countries data in core karl package as
  const data.

- LP #390868:  Updated OSI logo.

- LP #384841:  Add 'use_cache' kw argument to CachingCatalog to disable
  cache for particular searches.

- LP #391377: Moved settings such as 'system_email_domain' to karl.ini.

- Stop using a custom KarlSecurityPolicy; this policy was identical to
  the WhoInheritingACLSecurityPolicy in repoze.bfg 0.8+.  Use that one
  instead.

- LP #388096: Made a link to the community delete operation.

- LP #391247: Refactored console scripts to make them easier to test
  and maintain.  Renamed osi.ini to karl.ini.

- LP #391251: Moved osi/utilities to the karl package.

- Graceful handling if invalid 'To:' address in mailin.

- Mailin can now signal that it is wedged by writing a file, '.error', to
  its Maildir when it encounters an error.  This is easier to set up monitoring
  for than scraping the logs.  Humans will still need to read the logs when
  an error is found.

3.2 (2009-06-24)
----------------

- LP #387974:  Made 'edit_acl.html' view reindex context in the 'allowed'
  index, as well as invalidating any cached catalog queries.

- Added a simpler people directory implementation to the KARL core.

- For text index converters that use external programs, added a timeout thread
  to kill hanging processes.  Process is considered hanging after 5 seconds.
  This is to work around an error in wvConvert such that it will hang
  indefinitely for certain inputs.


3.1 (2009-06-16)
----------------

- LP #387390:  Add / enable delete profile view, deleting the corresponding
  user as well.

- LP #336714:  Added optional 'reason' argument to 'logout_view', to enable
  overriding the header value passed explaining why the user landed on the
  login form.  Use this argument when returning the logout response from
  another view.

- LP #385580:  Have the "Back to Parent" link not be full width on the <a>.

- LP #385268:  Email index is converted to lower case to facilitate case
  insensitive search.

- LP #385636: Better handling of existing users in invite new users form.


3.0 (2009-06-15)
----------------

- LP #384096: Intersect text index search results last for advanced search,
  improving relevance ranking.

- Micro-speedups for "communities" page.

- LP 386110:

  o Filter items in showtag view according to view permission of
    authenticated user.

  o Consolidated three showtag views to use same code.

  o Fix double slashes in profile view.

  o Make sure new user profiles get initialized with __acl__.


osi-production-20090611 (2009-06-11)
------------------------------------

- Temporarily revert commit to use "natural" order of text index
  committed in osi-production-20090610 because caused search queries
  to ignore catalog security info.


osi-production-20090610 (2009-06-10)
------------------------------------

- LP #384096: Updated code for generic search to use "natural" order of
  text index, where possible.

- Fixed 'karl.views.people.show_profile_view' not to blow up when
  userid != login.

- Add member_name index for text searching of just member names.
  NOTE: This requires running reindex_catalog -p /profiles

- Improved performance of member search widget in add_member_view


osi-production-20090608 (2009-06-08)
------------------------------------

- Switched to using a multi-adapter for footer (replaces hard-wired OSI
  branding).


osi-production-20090603 (2009-06-03)
------------------------------------

- Made the lastfirst index case-insensitive

- LP #382857: Sort community members by last name / first name.

- Use get_setting instead of looking ISettings.

- LP #382576: Use 'method="get"' in the advanced search form.  Also, gather
  vars for batching from either POST or GET submissions.

- grid: Fix initial sorting direction, and direction on the first click.

- grid: Make header borders collapse, and adjust column width calculations

- Added OfflineContextURL for enabling use of model_url outside of HTTP
  context, and registered OfflineContextURL as an adapter for OfflineRequest.

- LP #382572:

  o Ensure that community / profile tag listings are slpha-sorted.

- LP #381671:

  o Allow narrowing tagging APIs by user.

  o Pass user to profile-specific invocations of getFrequency.

  o Show better breadcrumbs in tag views.

  o Pass user to 'getRelatedTags' in 'profile_showtag_view'.

  o Show related tag links relative to profile / community / root.

- login: Disable all validation against spaces in the username.

- tagsearch: Fix tagsearch result list to never wrap, and extend its length
  for longer search results.


osi-production-20090531 (2009-05-31)
------------------------------------

- No changes to this package.


osi-production-20090528 (2009-05-28)
------------------------------------

- Initial version rolled out to replace KARL2.
